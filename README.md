# Pok√©mon FireRed Unlocked

The goal of this hack is to create a mininimally updated version of FireRed.

This is literally copy-pasted from pret's source code:

https://github.com/pret/pokefirered

Version 0.0 Features:

- All original 151 pokemon obtainable by either in-game NPC trades or capture.
  This does not include Mew, I have to figure out how to create a mini map event or something.

- All pokemon able to evolve via leveling or items.

- Minor enhancements that further enable the above two features (able to buy unlimited evolution items, ect...)
